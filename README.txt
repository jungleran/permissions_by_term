Permissions by Term
====================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Restricts users from the view of the taxonomy term page, if you've replaced the listing of nodes, which are attached to a taxonomy term, by the view. Additionally it disallows user to select taxonomy terms, for which they don't have access.

During work on a client project the Taxonomy Term Permissions module was forked. It couldn't handle a different language and couldn't handle permissions on a views page with listed taxonomy terms. So development happened and the result is the "Taxonomy Term Permissions"-module.
