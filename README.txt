Permissions by Term
====================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Restricts users from accessing the nodes related to specific taxonomy terms per
roles and users. Restriction also works for the view, which is replacing the
page for taxonomy term related nodes from the Drupal core
(taxonomy/term/TERM-ID).

Permissions by Term module additionally disallows users to select taxonomy
terms, for which they don't have access, on the node edit form.

WHY THIS MODULE WAS CREATED AND HOW?
------------------------------------
During work on a client project the Taxonomy Term Permissions module was
forked. It couldn't handle a different language and couldn't handle permissions
on a views page with listed taxonomy terms.
