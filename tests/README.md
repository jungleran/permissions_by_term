Behat tests
-----------
At https://github.com/jepster/permissions-by-term-behat you can find a PHP library
which provides a Behat context and examples for testing the Permissions by Term
module automatically. This library is an extension of the [Drupal Extension to Behat
and Mink project](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalextension).
